# Full Knight Traversal on (nxn)-size Chessboard

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This program uses recursion to simulate a knight piece traversing every square on a nxn size chessboard of any n greater than 4. It works by first assessing the possible moves from the knight's current position, as well as the onward moves from those possible moves. This allows for the program to make educated decisions on which move provides the greatest possibility of further moves, which allows the knight to keep moving across the board without hitting a dead end before traversing the board completely.</p>
